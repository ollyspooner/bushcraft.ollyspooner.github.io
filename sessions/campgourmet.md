# Camp gourmet

    Make a tasty dinner in the woods!

    We will use a camp cooking fire to produce a complete meal, then sit down to enjoy it in the natural environment. Several menu ideas are available and special requests are always a welcome challenge.

This can be done anywhere we can light a fire, so beaches are a good one too if the weather is good. I have a few good receipes that I have done before, but will happily research or invent more as needed.
