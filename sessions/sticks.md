    Make camp gadgets and furniture from materials in the environment.

    We can make chairs, tables, even a kitchen with a sink from natural wood and a few knots.

I need a good source of material for this, more if they want to keep what they have made (which may have to be incorporated into the price). I am planning to get in touch with a few forestry people to source straight branches between 50 and 100mm diameter cheaply, so watch this space.
