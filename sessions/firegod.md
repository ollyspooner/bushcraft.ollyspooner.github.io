# (Trainee) Fire god!

    So you can light a fire? Let's take away the matches ...
    ... and the firelighters ...
    ... and keep going as long as we can with more and more basic materials!

This could potentially test my fire lighting skills, but I am up for a challenge! It would be nice to be able to find materials on site, but I can bring a range of stuff to anywhere if needed.
