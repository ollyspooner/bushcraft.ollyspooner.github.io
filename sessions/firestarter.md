# "Fire starter" or Build and light a fire to cook dampers and a hot drink

## What will we do?

Learn how to make fire safely in the wild, and then get the kettle on!

We will start by learning about and finding fuel (let's be honest, it's mostly wood), then we will explore some different methods to get the fire lit.
While the fire gets established, we will contruct a device to hang our kettle on so that we can finish with a satisfying brew and toast some tasty snacks!

## Where?

From the Falmouth to Helston road, turn right at Crane's Garage. Go past the K9 Kennals and the gate is opposite Little Trewince. See the w3w for the specific location of the gateway. There is space for 1 vehicle to park.

## When?

We will aim to start at around 1400 on Sunday the 15th of June and we will run for about 3 hours.

## What should we wear?

While the forecast for the day is dry, prepare for a bit of rain anyway and there may be some wind, so dress warmly. Wear old clothes in case we get dirty.

## Anything else?

Due to dietary requirements we need to agree the details of any food and drink provided. I'll send suggestions for agreement shortly.

This one is pretty much good to go and can be done in a wide range of places.
