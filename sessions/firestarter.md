## What will we do?

Learn how to make fire safely in the wild, and then get the kettle on!

We will start by learning about and finding fuel (let's be honest, it's mostly wood), then we will explore some different methods to get the fire lit.
While the fire gets established, we will contruct a device to hang our kettle on so that we can finish with a satisfying brew and toast some tasty snacks!

## Where?

From the Falmouth to Helston road, turn right at Crane's Garage. Go past the K9 Kennals and the gate is opposite Little Trewince. See the w3w for the specific location of the gateway. There is space for 1 vehicle to park.

## When?

We will aim to start at around 1400 on Sunday the 15th of June and we will run for about 3 hours.

## What should we wear?

While the forecast for the day is dry, prepare for a bit of rain anyway and there may be some wind, so dress warmly. Wear old clothes in case we get dirty.

## Anything else?

Due to dietary requirements we need to agree the details of any food and drink provided. I'll send suggestions for agreement shortly.

This one is pretty much good to go and can be done in a wide range of places.

## Risk assesment

<table>
<tr><th>Hazard/Risk</th><th>
<tr><td>General obstructions (equipment and other items) – risk of injuries to people setting up, moving, or removing items.</td>
<td>Supervision of setting up any equipment used for the activity and moving to where it is needed, especially on uneven ground outdoors. No one should carry larger or awkward items on their own if possible. Care to be taken to ensure equipment has fully cooled before moving it at the end of the session. Keep any woodpiles a safe distance from the fire to avoid tripping on it and falling into the fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rough wood – risk of splinters or blisters from handling. Injuries from nails or staples in hands. Injuries to feet from standing on nails embedded in wood in the wood pile</td>
<td>Adult volunteers should tell everyone to take care when collecting, cutting or snapping wood. Young People supervised around wood piles and instructed not to climb over them. Participants should wear appropriate gloves. Care must be taken when standing on wood and strong foot wear to be worn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sharp items (saws, axes, and knives) – risk of injuries from mistakes or misuse.<br/>
Risk of injury to non-participants or observers.</td>
<td>Adult volunteers should be competent and give young people information and training before they use sharp items. Adult volunteers should supervise young people and continue to assess their competence. There should be at least one adult or Young Leader for each group taking part. Count out the sharp items and be clear on how many are being used. Then count the sharp items back in to make sure they’re all returned. Keep items masked (have their blade covered) and stored safely between uses. Create a safe cutting area (check guidance for safe size and distances).
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Burns</td><td>Provision of and guidance to use appropriate tools and PPE (gloves) when handling potentially hot items.<br/>Set boundaries around fire area to prevent accidental entry.<br/>Fires lit only in specific area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cuts from knives</td>
<td>Training on proper use of knives to avoid cuts if the knife slips.<br/>Knives to be kept folded or sheathed when not in use.<td></tr>
<tr><td>Axe injury</td>
<td>Axes to be used from a one knee position or otherwise aimed at the ground to avoid hitting legs.<br/>Axes to be kept hooded or with the cutting edge buried in a log or similar.</td></tr>
